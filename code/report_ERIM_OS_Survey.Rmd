# Introduction

<!-- Why did we administer the survey? Who asked us? -->
The Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM) is committed to Open Science, one way of knowing 

The RSM & ESE Open Science Survey was open to all researchers from the 6th of April to the 6th of May 2021. Questions were adapted from the [Swinburne Open Science Survey](https://osf.io/vpwf7/).

The survey explored how researchers perceive and use "open science" practices. Eight main topics were covered:

1. Preregistration
2. Open materials/code
3. Open data
4. Pre-publication archiving
5. Open access
6. General experience with open science practices
7. Awareness of available tools
8. Role of ERIM

This report has all the total responses (combined ESE and RSM)[^1].

For any comments or questions, please contact [Dr. Lizette Guzman-Ramirez](mailto:guzmanramirez@rsm.nl) (ERIM Research Data Steward) or [Dr. Antonio Schettino](mailto:schettino@eur.nl) (ERS Open Science Coordinator).

```{r load-clean-data}

ERIM_OS_clean <-
  read_csv(
    here("data", "preproc", "CLEAN_20210608_ERIM_OS_Survey.csv") 
    )

```

# Respondents

```{r complete-questionnaires-data}

# percentage of (in)complete questionnaires
ERIM_OS_clean_unfinished <- 
  ERIM_OS_clean %>% 
  group_by(participant) %>%
  summarize(survey = length(which(Finished == TRUE))/length(Finished)) %>%
  count(survey) %>% 
  mutate(
    survey = ifelse(survey == 0, "incomplete", "complete"),
    perc = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2), # calculate percentage
    lab_perc = paste(round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2), "%", sep = "") # percentage as text (for plot labels)
  )

```

A total of `r sum(ERIM_OS_clean_unfinished$n)` respondents started the survey, but only `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_clean_unfinished, survey == "complete"), n)` finished it.

```{r affiliation-data}

ERIM_OS_demographics <-
  read_csv(
    here("data", "preproc", "cluster0.csv")
  )

```

We asked participants their school, department, and research institute affiliation, together with their position. 

`r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_demographics, item == "Rotterdam School of Management (RSM)"), lab_perc)` of the respondents were from RSM, while `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_demographics, item == "Erasmus School of Economics (ESE)"), lab_perc)` were affiliated to ESE. For the percentages separately for each department, see Figure \@ref(fig:figure1).

```{r figure1, fig.cap = "INSERT FIGURE CAPTION HERE", out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure1.png"))

```

The majority of respondents (`r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_demographics, item == "ERIM"), lab_perc)`) were affiliated to ERIM, while `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_demographics, item == "Tinbergen"), lab_perc)` were affiliated to Tinbergen, `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_demographics, item == "Neither"), lab_perc)` to neither institute, and `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_demographics, item == "ERIM,Tinbergen"), lab_perc)` to both.

```{r school-position-response-rate-data}

total_researchers <- 
  tibble(
    position = rep(
      c(

ERIM_OS_school_position_response_rate <-
  ERIM_OS_clean %>%

```

The total survey response rate was `r total_survey_response_rate`. Table \@ref(tab:school-position-response-rate-table) presents the total response rate per research position and school.

# Preregistration

```{r preregistration-data}

ERIM_OS_preregistration <-
  read_csv(
    here("data", "preproc", "cluster2.csv")
  )

```

```{r preregistration-importance-data}

ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance <-
  ERIM_OS_preregistration %>% 
  filter(question == "In your opinion, how important for your field is it that researchers preregister their studies?")

```

The answers to the question *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration$question[1]`* reveals that respondents consider preregistration *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance$item[1]`* or *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance$item[2]`* (`r paste0(sum(ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance[1, "perc"], ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance[2, "perc"]), "%")`), while `r paste0(pull(filter(ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance, item == "Not at all important"), "perc"), "%")` believe that preregistration is *`r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_preregistration_importance, item == "Not at all important"), item)`*.

```{r preregistration-experience-data}

ERIM_OS_preregistration_experience <-
  ERIM_OS_preregistration %>% 
  filter(question == "What is your experience with study preregistration?")

```

From the question *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_experience$question[1]`*, we see that most respondents (`r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_preregistration_experience, item == "I am aware of study preregistration, but have not used it in my research"), lab_perc)`) are aware of preregistration but have not used it in their own projects. `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_preregistration_experience, item == "I regularly preregister my studies"), lab_perc)` of the respondents regularly preregister their studies, while `r pull(filter(ERIM_OS_preregistration_experience, item == "Until now, I was unaware of study preregistration"), lab_perc)` had never heard of preregistration before answering this survey. More details can be found in Figure \@ref(fig:figure2).

```{r figure2, fig.cap = "INSERT FIGURE CAPTION HERE", out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure2.png"))

```

```{r preregistration-concerns-data}

ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns <-
  ERIM_OS_preregistration %>% 
  filter(question == "The following are possible concerns that researchers could have about preregistering their studies. Which of these concerns would apply to you?") %>% 
  arrange(desc(perc))

```

Among the possible concerns that researchers could have about preregistering their studies, the top 3 are: 

* *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns$item[1]`* (`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns[1, "lab_perc"]`)
* *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns$item[2]`* (`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns[2, "lab_perc"]`)
* *`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns$item[3]`* (`r ERIM_OS_preregistration_concerns[3, "lab_perc"]`)

<!-- These are your old top 3, which are different from mine because I am using complete surveys only -->
<!-- Could you please verify that everything makes sense? -->

<!-- 25.66% - I need to look at my data before I can decide how to best analyze it. -->
<!-- 20.35% - Preregistration might lead to other people taking my research idea and implementing my plan. -->
<!-- 19.47% - Preregistration prevents exploratory research. -->

```{r figure3, fig.cap = "INSERT FIGURE CAPTION HERE", out.width = '100%'}

```






# Open materials/code

From the question In your opinion, how important for your field is it that materials and/or code are openly available?" we can see that more than 85% of the respondents think that using open materials and/or code is important (combining extremely, very, and moderately important), and only 2.6% think is not at all important.

# 
#  # summary of responses to cluster 3
#  cluster3 <-
#    ERIM_OS_clean %>%

#      lab_perc = paste(perc, "%", sep = "") # percentage as text (for labels)
#    ) %>%
#    ungroup()

```

```{r cluster-3-table}
# 
#  cluster3 %>% 
#    dplyr::select(-c(number_responses, perc)) %>% 
#    rename(percentage = lab_perc) %>%

```{r cluster-3-question-1, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

#knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "donut_cluster3_question1.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure4.png"))
```

From the question "What is your experience with using open materials and/or code?" we see that both schools are aware and have some experience with using open materials and/or code. There is a considerable amount (21%) of researchers that regularly use and/or create open materials and/or code and it is only a bit more than 7% of the respondents that have not heard of open materials and/or code before answering this survey. 

```{r cluster-3-question-2, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

#knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "donut_cluster3_question2.png"))

```

From the question "What is your experience with sharing open materials and/or code?" we can see that a bit more than 30% of respondents are aware of sharing materials and/or code, about 30% have some experience sharing materials and/or code, and similarly almost 30% of respondents regularly share open materials and/or code. 
Comparing this figure to the one above, we can assume that researchers at ESE and RSM share their materials and/or code more than what they re-use.


```{r cluster-3-question-3, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

#knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "donut_cluster3_question3.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure5.png"))
```

<!-- Make the figures bars -->
<!-- Figure 5 -->

From the question "The following are possible concerns that researchers could have about making their materials and/or code openly available. Which of these concerns would apply to you?" the top 3 concerns for that researchers could have about making their materials and/or code open are the following: 

19.47% - Others might find it difficult to understand my materials and/or code.

15.04% - I might lose control over how my materials and/or code are being used.

8.85% - Other researchers might criticise my materials and/or code

It is important to mention that the most popular answer (27.43%) was that researchers do not share any of these concerns with sharing their materials and/or code openly.

```{r cluster-3-question-4, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

#knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "donut_cluster3_question4.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure6.png"))
```

# Open data

From the question "In your opinion, how important for your field is it that data from published research are openly available?" we can see that more than 80% of the respondents think that using open data is important (combining extremely, very, and moderately important), and only a bit more than 5% think is not at all important. 

<!-- Make the figures bars and leave cluster4_question1 alone, then one figure that compares cluster4_question2 and cluster4_question3 horizontally together -->
<!-- Figure 7 -->
<!-- Figure 8 -->

```{r cluster-4-data}

# # summary of responses to cluster 4
# cluster4 <-
#   ERIM_OS_clean %>% 
#   dplyr::filter(
#     Finished == "TRUE" & # keep only complete questionnaires
#       cluster == "4" # keep only questions of relevant cluster
#   ) %>%
#   droplevels() %>% # drop unused levels
#   dplyr::select(-c(Finished, cluster)) %>% # drop unused columns
#   dplyr::select_if(~ sum(!is.na(.)) > 0) %>% # keep columns without NAs
#   # drop_na() %>% # drop rows with missing values
#   rename("item" = "value_1") %>% 
#   group_by(question, item) %>%
#   summarize(number_responses = n()) %>%
#   group_by(question) %>%
#   mutate(
#     perc = round(number_responses / sum(number_responses) * 100, 2), # calculate percentage
#     lab_perc = paste(perc, "%", sep = "") # percentage as text (for labels)
#   ) %>%
#   ungroup()

```

```{r cluster-4-table}

# cluster4 %>% 
#   dplyr::select(-c(number_responses, perc)) %>% 
#   rename(percentage = lab_perc) %>% 
#   kable_custom()

# Add images from 05_cluster4_figure.R
```

```{r cluster-4-question-1, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

#knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "donut_cluster4_question1.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure7.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure8.png"))
```

From the question "What is your experience with using open data?" we see that both schools are aware and have some experience with using open data. More than 21% of respondents regularly use open data and there is only a very small percentage of respondents (less than 3%) that have never heard of open data before taking this survey.  


```{r cluster-4-question-2, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

#knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "donut_cluster4_question2.png"))

```

From the question "What is your experience with sharing open data? we can see that almost 77% of respondents are aware of sharing open data and have some experience but do not share their data regularly, and almost 18% of respondents regularly share open data. 
Comparing this question with the one before, we can see that researchers have more experience using open data, than sharing their data openly.

```{r cluster-4-question-3, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

#knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "donut_cluster4_question3.png"))

```

From the question "The following are possible concerns that researchers could have about making their data openly available. Which of these concerns would apply to you? the top 3 concerns for that researchers could have about making their data open are the following: 

30.09% - There could be issues related to privacy.

14.16% - There could be issues related to intellectual property.

11.5% - There could be issues related to ethics. 

But a considerable percentage of respondents (17.7%) do not share any of these concerns. 

<!-- Make the figures bars and sort it  -->

#knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "donut_cluster4_question4.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure9.png"))
```

# Pre-publication archiving

From the question "In your opinion, how important is pre-publication archiving for your field?" we can see that around 55% of the respondents think that pre-publication is important (combining extremely, very, and moderately important), but almost 16% thinks it is not at all important. 

<!-- Make the figures bars and then one figure that compares cluster5_question1 and cluster5_question2 horizontally together -->
<!-- Figure 10 -->

```{r cluster-5-data}

# # summary of responses to cluster 5
# cluster5 <-
#   ERIM_OS_clean %>% 
#   dplyr::filter(
#     Finished == "TRUE" & # keep only complete questionnaires
#       cluster == "5" # keep only questions of relevant cluster
#   ) %>%
#   droplevels() %>% # drop unused levels
#   dplyr::select(-c(Finished, cluster)) %>% # drop unused columns
#   dplyr::select_if(~ sum(!is.na(.)) > 0) %>% # keep columns without NAs
#   # drop_na() %>% # drop rows with missing values
#   rename("item" = "value_1") %>% 
#   group_by(question, item) %>%
#   summarize(number_responses = n()) %>%
#   group_by(question) %>%
#   mutate(
#     perc = round(number_responses / sum(number_responses) * 100, 2), # calculate percentage
#     lab_perc = paste(perc, "%", sep = "") # percentage as text (for labels)
#   ) %>%
#   ungroup()

```

```{r cluster-5-table}

# cluster5 %>%

#knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "donut_cluster5_question1.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure10.png"))
```

From the question "What is your experience with pre-publication archiving?" we see that both schools are aware and have some experience with pre-publications. However, there is a similar percentage of respondents with opposite experience, a bit more than 20% of respondents have extensive experience with preprint archiving, while almost 19% has never heard of pre-publication archiving before they took this survey. 

```{r cluster-5-question-2, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

#knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "donut_cluster5_question2.png"))

```

From the question "The following are possible concerns that researchers could have about uploading a manuscript to a pre-publication archive before submitting it for peer review. Which of these concerns would apply to you?" the top 3 concerns that researchers could have about uploading a manuscript to a pre-publication archive before submitting it for peer review are the following: 

38.05% - Some journals might not publish findings that are uploaded to a pre-publication archive.

14.16% - Other people might copy my research and publish it before I do.

10.62% - Non-peer-reviewed findings might add noise to the literature.

But the second most common response (26.55%) was that researchers do not share any of these concerns.  

<!-- Make the figures bars  -->
<!-- Figure 11 -->

#knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "donut_cluster5_question3.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "figure11.png"))
```

# Open access

From the question Approximately what proportion of your publications from the last 5 years are open access?" we can see that 20% of the respondents don’t know or prefer not to answer. Almost 20% of the respondent have some of their publication open access, while almost 16% have most of their publication open access. However, 17.7% of the respondents have all or none (also 17.7%) of their publication open access.

```

```{r cluster-6-table}

cluster6 %>%

```

```{r cluster-6-question-1, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

#knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "donut_cluster6_question1.png"))

```

From the question Many open access journals charge a fee for processing the article for publication. How have you managed payment of these fees? we see that most Open Access fees were paid using the “blanket agreement” between VSNU and selected academic publisher, otherwise they responded that their open access publications did not involved fees. The 3rd mostly used resource was the Erasmus Open Access Fund.

# General experiences with open science practices 

From the question "What is your experience with Open Science practices?" more than 50% of the respondents have some experience with Open Science practices, a bit more than 10% have extensive experience, and a bit more than 35% are aware, but have not used any Open Science practices in their research.

From the statement "The following are possible barriers to the uptake of open science practices. Please place a tick beside any statement that you agree is a barrier in your field" the top 3 barriers to the uptake of open science practices are:

37.74% - Lack of funding for open access publishing.

13.27% - Lack of recognition in my field about the value of open science practices.

11.5% - Lack of credit in my institution for engaging in open science

# ERIM Open Science Strategy

ERIM is committed to Open Science. The main reason why we conducted this survey is that we needed to know where the gaps are. 

In order to provide enough support to our researchers ERIM is planning several interventions. 
1) A 3 year campaign (2021 - 2024) on different aspects of Open Science.
-In March 2021, ERIM conducted the ORCiD Madness Month,
