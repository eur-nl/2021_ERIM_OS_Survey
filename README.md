Code for analysis and visualization of the results of the 2021 ERIM Open Science Survey

When comparing:
1) Schools; Make sure both schools have the same weight (scale respondents to weight the same).
2) Departments; Use the percentage of respondents per department. 
3) Position; Use the percentage of respondents per position.
